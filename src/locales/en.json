		"text1": "After graduating from the School of Electrical Engineering for Computer Technicians, I am currently a student at the University of the North, where I obtained a bachelor's degree in multimedia and graphic technology engineering (bacc. ing. tech. graph.). I am continuing my education at the graduate study in Multimedia. I chose this major because of my passion for programming and connecting graphic design with functionality. I am particularly interested in frontend and backend development because I believe that these are areas that shape the future."
